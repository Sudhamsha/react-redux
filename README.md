## Todo App with React-Redux

Trying out Redux with React following course on [Egg Head](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-react-app-with-redux) to build a basic todo app. (This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).)

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
